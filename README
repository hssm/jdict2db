The purpose of this project is to create database representations of various
Japanese-English dictionaries that are provided as XML files.

The dictionaries used are the work of Jim Breen
(http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/japanese.html). Presently, KANJIDIC2 and
JMdict are supported by this project. JMnedict (Japanese Proper Names
Dictionary) will be added soon.
