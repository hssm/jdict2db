This project creates database representations of various Japanese-English
dictionaries that are provided as XML files.
 
The dictionaries used are the work of Jim Breen. More information can be found
at their respective pages:

KANJIDIC2 page: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic2/
JMdict page: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/jmdict.html

License information can be found in the file COPYING.

Presently, KANJIDIC2 and JMdict are supported by this project. JMnedict
(Japanese Proper Names Dictionary) will be added soon.
